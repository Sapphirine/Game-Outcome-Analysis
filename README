========== OVERVIEW ==========

This is Raymond Barker's (rjb2150) final project for
Columbia University EECS E6893 (Big Data Analytics).

The project name is Game Outcome Analysis.

Specifically, it's focused on predicting the outcome
of chess games given only a single board state.

Note that chess games are stored in a standardized
format known as Portable Game Notation (PGN).

This repository contains the following major source
code components:
• A library to parse and vectorize PGN files
• A library for classifying vectors using Mahout
• A demonstration script which uses these together

Note that my development environment was Eclipse on OS X.

See below for additional details.

========== BACKGROUND ==========

For more background see the final report, final presentation, and
the following project description.

The goal of this project was to be able to answer to following question: 
• given a game state, who will win? 

Specifically, this project focused on games that are: 
• two-team 
• each team can be represented as a multiset of predefined members 

Many games fall into this category: 
• chess (each team is composed of N pawns, M rooks, etc.) 
• deck-building games (each team is composed of predefined cards) 
• MMORPGs (each team is composed of various “classes”) 

However, I ultimately was only able to look at chess games.

Dataset: The dataset used is a corpus of chess games in the public domain,
compiled by Norman Pollock, available here: http://hoflink.com/~npollock/chess.html 
• dataset id: gm2006.pgn 
• number of games: 74,726 
• number of players: 1,227 
• minimum player Elo rating: 2475 
• years included: 2006 - 2014 
• gameplay restrictions: no blitz or correspondence games 

Language: Java (personally, I developed on OS X) 

Analytics: primarily Mahout, with various other support libraries (Guava, etc.)
